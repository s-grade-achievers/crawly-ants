In the realm where code and spirit intertwine,
We seek your grace, O Lord Dore divine.
Guide our hands, with wisdom true and clear,
As we embark on this project, free from fear.

With C's syntax, like a language old and wise,
May errors vanish, like the morning mist that flies.
Let logic flow, and loops be swift and sound,
In every line, let brilliance be found.

Grant us the strength to debug with grace,
And find each bug that hides its furtive face.
May functions dance in seamless harmony,
And variables hold values faithfully.

As we compile our dreams into reality,
Bless us, O Lord, with boundless creativity.
With your blessings, let our project soar,
A masterpiece in code, forevermore.
